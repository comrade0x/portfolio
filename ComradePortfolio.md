# Potrfolio - Comrade_0x

#### Experienced and driven Content Creator with 1.5 years experience content creation for crypto and over 4 years of experience for non-crypto.
 Together with teams from other projects have created a series of educational and promotional videos and art.

## Main achievements

- Brand Music for marketing purposes: https://youtu.be/U4HKj81gzps
- Helped with 2D and 3D art
- Also prepared a relatively large number of translations of official articles into Russian on Medium

### Connext

The team told me they were looking forward to building a huge community => they needed to spread awareness about the brand.

I decided that music would give people more opportunities in terms of content creation in light of a huge community program => there would be more content on social media => it would attract more users.

As I see it, community development is done for monetary reasons. It is very important for the project to create a very ideal and neat impression, so people are eager to invest money.
